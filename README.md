# I created this project just for fun!
## The "Press and hold" captcha beat me. I couldn't solve it or bypass it. I tried undetected-chromedriver, proxies, ...(whatever) but nothing worked, the captcha still appeared randomly.
## Anyway, if you know how to, feel free to do whatever you want with my project :)
## There were more parts I wanted to add, but once I realized I couldn't bypass this captcha, I stopped coding. (gave up)
